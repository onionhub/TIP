The answer is that Young was an image processing expert, we wrongly supposed that he was a physicist.

This document will discuss about the reason of the existing relativity in image processing. More critically, it will be discussed duality principle of particle-wave of quantum from image processing perspective.

We think that these topics might help to introduce the mathematical model of the proposed filter which will more help to design effecient filters in the future.

This document will be added on 1 May.
