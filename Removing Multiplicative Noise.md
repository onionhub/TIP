# Removing Multiplicative Noise
In the paper we have just conducted experiments on Gaussian noise. 
In this document we will show how the proposed filter can improve other image denoising methods' performance.
## AA model
We showed the efficiency of the proposed method on a variational approach for removing multiplicative noise which has been introduced in the below refrence.

- Parameters
```
ug=Input
c1=15
c2=-6
Cl=0
uk=AA1(Input)
E(uk)=imgradient(uk,'central')
ul=u-AA2(Input)
AA1 and AA2 means AA model with different lamda, but we considered AA1=AA2 in the example.
```
## AA model as filter for uk and ul to improve the results of the other multiplicative denoising
