# Removing Multiplicative Noise
In the paper we have just conducted experiments on Gaussian noise. 
In this document we will show how the proposed filter can improve other image denoising methods' performance.
We showed the performance of the proposed methods on a variational approach for removing multiplicative noise from the below refrence.
