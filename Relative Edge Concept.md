# Relative Edge Concept
```
-Colors Interpretation:
Red: Indicates relative* strong edges.
Green: Indicates relative* weak edges.
Yellow: Indicates relative* strong edge in one direction, like x-direction, and relative* weak edge in other direction.
```
Features in images are relative from two perspectives which have been adressed as relative* and relative** in this document. We consider the edges as a manifest features in image processing.
## Relative*
The edges are relative in an image based on the value of the gradient they have.

- Relative* strong regions

- Relative* flat regions

## Relative**
The edge are relative in spatial domain from different frequency bands aspects.

- Relative** strong regions

- Relative** flat regions
