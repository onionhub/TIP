# Relative Edge Concept
```
-Colors Interpretation:
Red: Indicates strong edges.
Green: Indicates weak edges.
Yellow: Indicates strong edge in one direction, like x-direction, and weak edge in other direction.
```
Features in images are relative from two perspectives which have been adressed as relative* and relative** in this document. We consider the edges a manifest features in image processing.
- Relative*
The edges are relative in an image based on the value of the gradient they have.
- Relative**
