# Relative Edge Concept
```
-Colors Interpretation:
Red: Indicates relative** strong edges.
Green: Indicates relative** weak edges.
Yellow: Indicates relative** strong edge in one direction, like x-direction, and relative** weak edge in other direction.
```
Notice: <i>relative*</i> and <b>relative**</b> both have the same meaning in the text, and they are not different words with different meaning. For ease of reading and understanding, we have just marked them with * and **.

<i>relative*</i> = <b>relative**</b> = relative word in oxford dictionary.

Features in images are relative from two perspectives which have been adressed as <i>relative*</i> and <b>relative**</b> in this document. We consider the edges as a manifest features in image processing.
## <i>Relative*</i>
The edges are relative in an image based on the value of the gradient they have.

- <i>Relative*</i> strong regions

According to the conventional assumption in image processing, those regions with high gradient value are potential volunteers for the edges. In other words, those regions are the strong regions <i>relative*</i> to the other regions.

- <i>Relative*</i> flat regions

The rest of the regions count as flat regions <i>relative*</i> to strong regions; those regions with low gradient values.

## <b>Relative**</b>
The <i>relative*</i> strong regions are <b>relative**</b> in spatial domain from different frequency bands aspects. <i>relative*</i> strong regions are <b>relative**</b> in respect to the frequency band we study the image if we consider two constraints:
1) All methods' mathematics and the way of their implementation are invariant. For example, finite difference methods should chose the same spatial step (same pattern of Euclidean distance between mesh points in all derived signals of a given filter) when they are used to approximate nth-order derivatives in image processing, like first-order backward difference for computing the edges.
2) Delat function is absolute feature. In other words, u=0 does not count as signal or image, and any feature occupies some space in spatial domain in order to be able to seperate it into different regions from mathematical perspective.

- <b>Relative**</b> strong regions

These regions always belong to <i>relative*</i> strong regions but they count as strong regions <b>relative**</b> to the frequency band which we study the image.
These regions are not invariant in all frequency bands. In other words, some parts of it can be counted as <b>relative**</b> flat regions in a specific frequency band, or some other parts can be added to these parts from <b>relative**</b> flat regions.

- <b>Relative**</b> flat regions

Quite the contrary, these regions might not always count as <i>relative*</i> strong regions and they might be either <i>relative*</i> strong regions or <i>relative*</i> flat regions in different frequency bands. 
These regions are not invariant in all frequency bands. In other words, some parts of it can be counted as <b>relative**</b> strong regions in a specific frequency band, or some other parts can be added to these parts from <i>relative*</i> flat regions.
# We will speak more in details and give some interpretations about the below images whitin 24 hours.
