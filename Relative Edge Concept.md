# Relative Edge Concept
```
-Colors Interpretation:
Red: Indicates relative** strong edges.
Green: Indicates relative** weak edges.
Yellow: Indicates relative** strong edge in one direction, like x-direction, and relative** weak edge in other direction.
```
Features in images are relative from two perspectives which have been adressed as relative* and relative** in this document. We consider the edges as a manifest features in image processing.
## Relative*
The edges are relative in an image based on the value of the gradient they have.

- Relative* strong regions
According to the conventional assumption in image processing, those regions with high gradient value are potential volunteers for the edges. In other words, those regions are the strong regions in relative to the other regions.

- Relative* flat regions
The rest of the regions count as flat regions; those regions with low gradient values.

## Relative**
The Relative* strong regions are relative in spatial domain from different frequency bands aspects. Relative* strong regions are relative in respect to the frequency band we study image if we consider two constraints:
1) All methods' mathematics and the way of their implementation are invariant. For example, finite difference methods should chose the same spatial step (same pattern of Euclidean distance between mesh points in all derived signals of a given filter) when they are used to approximate nth-order derivatives in image processing, like first-order backward difference for computing the edges.
2) Delat function is absolute feature. In other words, u=0 does not count as signal or image, and any feature occupies some space in spatial domain in order to be able to seperate it into different regions from mathematical perspective.

- Relative** strong regions
These regions always belong to relative* strong regions but they count as strong regions in relative to the frequency band which we study the image.
These regions are not invariant in all frequency bands. In other words, some parts of it can be counted as relative** flat regions in a specific frequency band, or some other parts can be added to these parts from <b>relative**</b> flat regions.

- Relative** flat regions
Quite the contrary, these regions might not always count as relative* strong regions and they might be either relative* strong regions or relative* flat regions in different frequency bands. 
These regions are not invariant in all frequency bands. In other words, some parts of it can be counted as relative** strong regions in a specific frequency band, or some other parts can be added to these parts from <b>relative*</b> flat regions.
# We will speak more in details and give some interpretations about the results whitin 24 hours.
