- Current sentence:
Ch and Cl can be either constant coefficients or non-negative monotonically decreasing and non-negative monotonically increasing functions in respect to uk, respectively.
- Revised:
Ch can be either constant coefficient or non-negative monotonically decreasing (if sign(ch)>0) and non-positive monotonically increasing function function (if sign(ch)<0) in respect to uk. Cl can be either constant coefficient or non-negative monotonically increasing function in respect to uk.

- Current:
Cl has been chosen 0 for all of the experiments except for the real-world images which we were sure that there is almost no noise in the images.
- Revised:
This sentence should be removed completely. Because, we have used Cl=1 for Fig. 7 and Fig. 9. It is not a currect statement.
