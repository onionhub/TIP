# Why pre-processing?
This fact comes from the second law; dela function is absolute feature. The second law helps us to use the filter as a strong pre-processing tool in order to improve the performance of the other methods which weakly preserve the edges.

As we know, there is no any ideal filter in the nature, also all of the capturing devices acts as a filtering device. In other words, there is not any device which can work in whole bandwitch. Therefore, there is not exist any capturing device to be able to capture an image which delta function be its feature. It does not matter how much quality of a picture is excellent, the matter is we can consider any picture as a filtered image in the nature. Hence, always there is possiblity to courage the features of images in order to make them more closer to an absolute feature.

We are trying to prove this phenomena in the practice and we will uploaded some practical example regard to show the case in real-world.
