# Why pre-processing?
This fact comes from the second law; dela function is absolute feature. The second law helps us to use the filter as a strong pre-processing tool in order to improve the performance of the other methods which weakly preserve the edges.

As we know, there is no any ideal filter in the nature, also all of the capturing devices acts as a filtering device. In other words, there is not any device which can work in whole bandwitch. Therefore, there is not any capturing device to be able to capture an image which delta function be its feature. It does not matter how much quality of a picture is excellent, the matter is that we can consider any picture as a filtered image in the nature. Hence, always there is possibility to courage the features of images in order to make them more closer to an absolute feature.

The picture inside the phone is the picture of an ideal step function in real-world which delta function is its feature. The secenod picture, which has been taken from the phone, is the picture of an ideal step function. The second picture is not either an ideal step function, because its space is an undercut of the space in which the ideal step function exists. Therefore, the picture of an ideal step function can not have delta function as its feature, unless we have a capturing device with infinity resolution.

Without loss of generality, consider that our world has one dimension. If we could have a capturing device with infinite resolution in the supposed dimention, it would be the same space with one dimention and picture will be meaningless. Two things make an image of a subject to be meaningful; time and space. Consider that time is invariant, a capturing device, with infinite dimention of the space it works, would copy the same space into the same space which is meaningless. Therefore, it is not possible to capture an image with delta function as its feature.

The first law helps us to preserve the space that a delta function can be exist and prevent us from manipulating a space to have a delta function in a undercut space of an image.
