# Why pre-processing?
This fact comes from the second law; dela function is absolute feature. The second law helps us to use the filter as a strong pre-processing tool in order to improve the performance of the other methods which weakly preserve the edges.

As we know, there is no any ideal filter in the nature, also all of the capturing devices acts as a filtering device. In other words, there is not any device which can work in whole bandwitch. Therefore, there is not any capturing device to be able to capture an image which delta function be its feature. It does not matter how much quality of a picture is excellent, the matter is that we can consider any picture as a filtered image in the nature. Hence, always there is possibility to courage the features of images in order to make them more closer to an absolute feature.

The picture inside the phone is the picture of an ideal step function in real-world which delta function is its feature. The second picture, which has been taken from the phone, is the picture of an ideal step function. The second picture is not either an ideal step function in the space of the first picture inside the phone. Because, its space is an undercut of the space in which the ideal step function exists. Therefore, the picture of an ideal step function can not have delta function as its feature, unless we have a capturing device with infinity resolution.

Without loss of generality, consider that our world has one dimension. If we could have a capturing device with infinite resolution in the supposed dimension, it would be the same space with one dimension and picture will be meaningless in that space. Two things make an image of a subject to be meaningful; time and space. Consider that time is invariant, a capturing device, with infinite domain of the space where it works, would copy the same space into the same space which is meaningless. Therefore, it is not possible to capture an image with delta function as its feature in real-world. I do not say that it is impossible to create a capturing device with infinite domain in a given dimention; just to say that somthing is impossible is impossible. I meant that picture would not be a meaningful concept in that case; picturing a space into the same space will be useless and meaningless.

Moreover, one can consider that the second image (image of the phone) can be expanded to an infinite domain by putting zeros in each different dimension of the image, which lead to have an ideal step function by that assumption. In this case, by applying the second term of the proposed filter to the image we would have smooth step function with smooth edge which is in absolute contrast to the eq. (20) of the paper. The equation says that the slope of the output should be increased, but it would have decreased! Hence, the second law hinder us to manipulate the space of images. The disscussed manipulation is not in contrast with the first law, because we add zeros to every derived signals of a given filter. But, by the example, we saw that the first law is not sufficient to have relativity concept in image processing, which leads us to have the second law beside of the first law.

The first law helps us to preserve the space that a delta function can be exist and prevent us from manipulating a space to have a delta function in an undercut space of an image. The second law helps us to have a relativity concept in image processing by having an absolute space which delta function can be defined there.
