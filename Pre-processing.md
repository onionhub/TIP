# Why pre-processing?
The second law, delat function is absolute feature, helps us to use the filter as a strong pre-processing tool in order to improve the performance of the other methods which weakly preserve the edges.

As we know, there is no any ideal filter in the nature, also all of the capturing devices acts as a filtering device. In other words, there is not any device which can work in whole bandwitch. Therefore, there is not exist any capturing device to be able to capture an image which delta function be its feature.
