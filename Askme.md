# TIP
In order to have an interactive review, I suggest these two methods:
- Method 1
```
Please go to the "Issues" (https://github.com/onionhub/TIP/issues) and create new issue, if you need further information about the paper or you have trouble running the codes. All issues and questions will be deleted after 24 hours.
```
- Method 2
```
Send me (to: ehsun.assadi@gmail.com) your Slack ID or your Email in order to invite you to a channel in Slack which has been devised for reviewing the paper.
```
Notice: in all of these methods, remaining anonymous is all on you.
